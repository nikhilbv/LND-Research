## Problems Apollo Baidu has solved using AI
#### 1. Lidar Point Cloud Obstacle Detection & Classification
* Input - Lidar data
* Annotation type - 3D bbox
* Labels - pedestrians, vehicles, non-motor vehicles (cyclists) and others (dontCares)
* The Laser scanner used for the data acquisition is Velodyne HDL-64E S3
* More details - http://data.apollo.auto/help?name=data_intro_3d&data_key=lidar_obstacle_label&data_type=0&locale=en-us&lang=en

#### 2. Traffic Lights Detection
* Input - 1080P colorized images
* Annotation type - 2D bbox
* Annotations include: locations of traffic lights, colors of lights (red, yellow, green, black), shapes of lights (round, arrow, etc.), types of lights (horizontal, vertical, square, etc.) and other information
* Two cameras for the data collection of traffic lights are mounted on the car roof, one of which uses a lens with a focal length of 25mm and the other uses a lens with a focal length of 6mm 
* More details - http://data.apollo.auto/help?name=data_intro_2d&data_key=traffic_light_label&data_type=0&locale=en-us&lang=en

#### 3. Road Hackers
* Dataset provides two types of data including images in front of vehicles and the vehicle motion status
* The vehicle motion status data include the current speed and the track curvature
* The data of Road Hackers come from the original data of the sensor, including images, laser radars, radars, etc., which are mainly input in the form of images
* It outputs the vehicle’s control instructions, such as the steering wheel angle, acceleration, and braking
* The input and output are connected through the deep neural network, that is, to directly generate the vehicle control instructions through the neural network to carry out the horizontal control and vertical control of the vehicle
* Horizontal control : steering wheel angle
* Vertical control : acceleration and braking
* The platform mainly uses the horizontal control model. It trains the steering wheel control model through the images in front of the vehicle collected by the map collection cars
*  The output here does not use the steering wheel angle. It uses the curvature to be driven (ie, the reciprocal of the turning radius). The reasons are as follows:
1 The curvature is more universally applicable, which is not affected by the vehicle’s own parameters such as steering ratio, wheel base and so on.
2 The relationship between the curvature and the steering wheel angle is simple, which can be retrieved through the Ackermann model at a low speed and be fitted through a simple network at a high speed.

#### 4. Obstacle Detection[ Image based ]
* Input - 1080P colorized images
* Annotation type - 2D bbox
* Labels - vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, tricycle and other unmovable obstacles on the road
* Two cameras for the data collection of obstacles are mounted on the car roof, one of which uses a lens with a focal length of 6mm and the other uses a lens with a focal length of 12mm

#### Road profile DNN hunt and experimentation to extract road profiles (line geometry like lanes, road edges etc.) which has the geometric sense (x,y,z,y,p,r w.r.t. camera position as 0,0,0)
**- as measured by:**
- Total number of DNNArch referred - not less than 5
- Total number of DNNArch deployed locally and experimented with ob gaze dataset - not less than 2
- Clarity and depth of documentation on the learning of the research - excel sheet, docs, workflow diagrams in internal git-rep
	+ Documentation, experiment results on the understanding and providing insights on differences in the architectural differences this class of DNNArch w.r.t. object detection/segmentation DNNArch (in particular mask_rcnn). For example, reasoning on:
    
	i) Why lanet is better than mask_rcnn for lane segmentation?
	
    ii) Can lanet be used in place of mask_rcnn for object segmentation for object segmentation?

### * SCNN Notes
* CNNs are great for extracting semantics from raw pixels but perform poorly on capturing the spatial relationships (e.g. rotational and translational relationships) of pixels in a frame. These spatial relationships, however, are important for the task of lane detection, where there are strong shape priors but weak appearance coherences.
* For example, it is hard to determine traffic poles solely by extracting semantic features as they lack distinct and coherent appearance cues and are often occluded.
*  Spatial CNN (SCNN) proposes an architecture which “generalizes traditional deep layer-by-layer convolutions to slice-by slice convolutions within feature maps”.
*  In a traditional layer-by-layer CNN, each convolution layer receives input from its preceding layer, applies convolutions and nonlinear activation, and sends the output to the succeeding layer.
*  SCNN takes this a step further by treating individual feature map rows and columns as the “layers”, applying the same process sequentially (where sequentially means that a slice passes information to the succeeding slice only after it has received information from the preceding slices), allowing message passing of pixel information between neurons within the same layer, effectively increasing emphasis on spatial information.

|For example, it is hard to determine traffic poles solely by extracting semantic features as they lack distinct and coherent appearance cues and are often occluded.| SCNN takes this a step further by treating individual feature map rows and columns as the “layers”, applying the same process sequentially (where sequentially means that a slice passes information to the succeeding slice only after it has received information from the preceding slices), allowing message passing of pixel information between neurons within the same layer, effectively increasing emphasis on spatial information.|Due to the fact that the transformation parameters are fixed for all images, this raises issues when non flat ground-planes are encountered, e.g. in slopes. To alleviate this problem, we train a network, referred to as H-Net, that estimates the parameters of an ”ideal” perspective transformation, conditioned on the input image.|
||Gets curve line from probability map from matlab|Most popular detect-and-segment approaches (e.g. [14] Mask R-CNN, [38] J. Dai, K. He, and J. Sun. Instance-aware semantic segmentation via multi-task network cascades. In CVPR, 2016) are not ideal for lane instance segmentation, since bounding box detection is more suited for compact objects, which lanes are not.|

#### * H-Net Notes
* The output of LaneNet is a collection of pixels per lane
* Fitting a polynomial through these pixels in the original image space is not ideal, as one has to resort to higher order polynomials to be able to cope with curved lanes.
*  A frequently used solution to this problem is to project the image into a ”bird’s-eye view” representation, in which lanes are parallel to each other and as such, curved lanes can be fitted with a 2nd to 3rd order polynomial.
*  However, in these cases the transformation matrix H is calculated once, and kept fixed for all images. Typically, this leads to errors under ground-plane changes where the vanishing-point, which is projected onto infinity, shifts up or downwards.
*  To resolve this issue we train a neural network, H-Net, with a custom loss function: the network is optimized end-toend to predict the parameters of a perspective transformation H, in which the transformed lane points can be optimally fitted with a 2nd or 3rd order polynomial. The prediction is conditioned on the input image, allowing the network to adapt the projection parameters under ground-plane changes, so that the lane fitting will still be correct. 
*  In our case, **H has 6 degrees of freedom**:
    ```
    H =  a b c
        0 d e
        0 f 1 ]
    ```
The zeros are placed to enforce the constraint that horizontal lines remain horizontal under the transformation.

1. Each xxxxx.line.txt is the annotation file for the image xxxxx.jpg. In the annotation file, each line gives the x,y coordinates for key points of a lane marking.
2. The images in laneseg_label_w16 are all black because the pixel values are around 0-4, (0 for background, 1-4 for four lane markings.) So it looks black in 0-255 images.
3. We care about 4 lane markings: 2 on the left and 2 on the right.
  * `1 1 1 0` means you have 2 lane markings on the left, one lane marking on the right.
  * `0 1 1 1` means you have 1 lane marking on the left, two lane markings on the right.
